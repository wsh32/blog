Hi! I'm Wesley Soo-Hoo. I'm a robotics engineering undergraduate student at the Olin College of Engineering. I'm passionate about the power of robotics. I love experimenting with new and innovative ideas that have the power to change the world.

### Olin College

I am currently a student at [Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering](https://olin.edu). Olin is a tiny, engineering-only private college about half an hour outside Boston. Olin is well-known in the academic circles for it's innovative way to teach engineering through project based learning and it's focus on student feedback.
